        <h2>What It Is and How It Works</h2>
        <p>A habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit.

            The most basic format is to get a calendar and cross off each day you stick with your routine. For example, if you meditate on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, each of those dates gets an X. As time rolls by, the calendar becomes a record of your habit streak.
            
            
            
            To make this process as easy as possible,habit tracker is here. All you have to do is add your habit and start crossing off the days.
            
            Placing an X on each day is the classic look. I prefer something a little more design-oriented, so I shade in the cells on my habit tracker. You could also use checkmarks or fill your habit tracker with dots.
            
            
            
            No matter what design you choose, the key point is your habit tracker provides immediate evidence that you completed your habit. It's a signal that you are making progress. </p>
